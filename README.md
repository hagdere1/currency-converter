## Description

Currency Converter
is a currency exchange converter application built with Ruby on Rails and React.js/Flux.

Its backend stores the exchange rates in a PostgreSQL database and makes an AJAX request to the Fixer.io API once per 24 hours to fetch the most current rates. The app's RESTful JSON API serves this data to the React frontend, which takes advantage of a Flux architecture.
